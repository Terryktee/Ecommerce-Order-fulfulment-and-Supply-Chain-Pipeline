# 📦 E-Commerce Logistics Data Pipeline & OLAP System

## 🚨 Problem

E-commerce logistics operations generate large volumes of data from multiple systems, including orders, shipments, warehouse operations, delivery times and customer feedback.

However, this data is often fragmented, inconsistent and stored in different formats. As a result:

* Reporting is delayed
* Real-time visibility into order fulfilment is limited
* Data quality issues reduce trust in analytics
* Identifying supply chain bottlenecks becomes difficult
* Manual data handling increases operational risk

Without an integrated data pipeline and structured analytical model, transforming raw logistics data into reliable, decision-ready insights is challenging.

## ✅ Solution

This project implements a **cloud-based data pipeline** and builds an **OLAP-ready data warehouse** to enable efficient logistics analytics.

The solution:

* Integrates data from multiple operational systems
* Cleans and standardizes data for quality and consistency
* Transforms raw data into a dimensional (star schema) model
* Enables fast, multidimensional OLAP analysis
* Supports data-driven decision-making through BI tools

The result is a scalable analytical system that improves visibility, performance monitoring, and strategic decision-making in e-commerce logistics.
